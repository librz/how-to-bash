You should be familiar with most commands listed in [GNU Coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/)

Most linux comes with GUN Coreutils, if you are on a mac & have `brew` installed, you can do `brew install coreutils` to install them.

Here are a few examples from `GNU Coreutils`:

- `arch`: print CPU architecture
- `hostname`: print system's hostname
- `printenv`: print all environment variables
- `nohup`: run a command in the background
