head & tail, as their name suggests, shows the head & tail of multiple lines

#### Show the last 5 lines of a file

```sh
# or
tail -n 5 {{filename}}
# or
tail -n5 {{filename}}
# or
tail -5 {{filename}}
```


#### Show all lines (starting from the 5th line)

```sh
tail -n +5 {{filename}}
```

head's syntax is same as tail
