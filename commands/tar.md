`tar` is an archive & compress utility

#### options

`tar` has several options and u can combine them together, namely:

1. `c` for create
2. `z` for gzip
3. `x` for extract(unarchive)
4. `t` for list
5. `f` for file, seems to be always needed
6. `--exclude`: exclude certain file/folder(s)

#### list contents of an archive

`tar tf path/to/archvie`

#### archive

1. create an archive file from several files: `tar -cf path/to/target.tar path/to/file1 path/to/file2 ...`
2. create a gzipped archive file: `tar -czf path/to/target.tar.gz path/to/file1 path/to/file2 ...`
3. create an archive file of an directory: `tar -cf path/to/target.tar path/to/target`
4. create an archive file of an dir but excluding certain folders/files: `tar --exlcude="path/to/folder_or_file/1" --exclude="path/to/folder_or_file/2" -cf path/to/target.tar path/to/target`

#### extract (unarchive)

`tar -xf path/to/archive -C path/of/extracted_files`

in case of tar bomb where a tar file directly contains a lot of file, it's recommendated to create a temp folder first, then put the extracted files in it
