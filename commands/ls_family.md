*ls family commands are commands starting with ls, they are usually inside /usr/bin, you can list them using: ls -l /usr/bin/ls\**

### ls 

list out files & folders under a certain folder, if no folder is specified, it default to current folder

```sh
# simple usage
ls
# colored output (this usually seperates folder from regular file)
ls --color=auto
# by default, ls won't list out hidden files(file starts with a dot), to list them, using -a options
ls -a
# "ls -a" will also list out current folder as "." & its parent folder as "..", which is often unnecessary, to elliminate them, use -A
ls -A
# list items in their long form
ls -l
# list items in their long form, with human-readable file size
ls -lh
# annotate directory with "/" in the end (this is useful when you need to tell whether it's a file or folder)
ls -p
```

```sh
# sort items 
ls --sort=size # sort by file size
ls -S # short form

ls --sort=time # sort by last modified time
ls -t # short form

ls --sort=extension # sort by extension
ls -X # short form
```

```sh
# you probably want to use this by default
ls -AXlh --color=auto
```

### lscpu

lscpu list out information about your cpu, it's based on file /proc/cpuinfo, but much concise.

the following is an example of `lscpu` output

```
Architecture:                    x86_64
CPU op-mode(s):                  32-bit, 64-bit

On-line CPU(s) list:             0-15

NUMA node0 CPU(s):               0-15
```

note that the CPU count is 16, it doesn't mean I have 16 physical CPU on the motherboard, here the CPU refers to logical CPU, the ones that can be recognized & used by the operating system

### lsblk

lsblk stands for "list block devices", it's useful if you want to list out storage devices (such as disks , usb flash drive, sd card, etc)

lsblk list out devices & their partitions in a tree like format & shows the mountpoint of mounted partitions

the following is an example of `lsblk` output

``` 
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda           8:0    0   477G  0 disk /media/rz/Infinity
sdb           8:16   1   7.2G  0 disk 
└─sdb1        8:17   1   7.2G  0 part /media/rz/Photography
mmcblk0     179:0    0  59.5G  0 disk 
└─mmcblk0p1 179:1    0  59.5G  0 part /media/rz/3635-3539
nvme0n1     259:0    0   477G  0 disk 
├─nvme0n1p1 259:1    0   260M  0 part /boot/efi
├─nvme0n1p2 259:2    0    16M  0 part 
├─nvme0n1p3 259:3    0   200G  0 part 
├─nvme0n1p4 259:4    0 140.2G  0 part 
├─nvme0n1p5 259:5    0  1000M  0 part 
└─nvme0n1p6 259:6    0 135.5G  0 part /
```

from the output, we know that out linux system (mountpoint /) is a parition called "nvme0n1p6" on disk "nvme0n1"

we also know we have 3 external storage devices & can access file in them through their mountpoint

you can use "-f" option to get info about filesystem of each partition & their usage

the following is an example of `lsblk -f` output

```
NAME        FSTYPE   LABEL       UUID                                 FSAVAIL FSUSE% MOUNTPOINT

```

### lsmem 

a simple command to print out how much physcial memory you have on your system

here's an example output

```
RANGE                                  SIZE  STATE REMOVABLE  BLOCK
0x0000000000000000-0x00000000cfffffff  3.3G online       yes   0-25
0x0000000100000000-0x000000072fffffff 24.8G online       yes 32-229

Memory block size:       128M
Total online memory:      28G
Total offline memory:      0B
```

### lsusb

lsusb prints all usb devices connected to your system

example output:

```
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 003 Device 003: ID 04f2:b71f Chicony Electronics Co., Ltd Integrated Camera
Bus 003 Device 002: ID 046d:c545 Logitech, Inc. USB Receiver
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 002 Device 007: ID 0bda:8153 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8153 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter
Bus 002 Device 006: ID 05e3:0749 Genesys Logic, Inc. USB3.0 Hub             
Bus 002 Device 005: ID 0bda:0411 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. 
Bus 002 Device 004: ID 152d:0578 JMicron Technology Corp. / JMicron USA Technology Corp. JMS567 SATA 6Gb/s bridge
Bus 002 Device 003: ID 2109:0817 VIA Labs, Inc. USB3.0 Hub             
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 04f3:0c4b Elan Microelectronics Corp. ELAN:Fingerprint
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 8087:0029 Intel Corp. 
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 046d:c08b Logitech, Inc. G502 HERO Gaming Mouse
Bus 001 Device 008: ID 2109:8817 VIA Labs, Inc. 
Bus 001 Device 007: ID 0bda:5411 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. ELAN:Fingerprint
Bus 001 Device 006: ID 1a40:0801 Terminus Technology Inc. 
Bus 001 Device 005: ID 2109:2817 VIA Labs, Inc. USB2.0 Hub             
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
```

in this example, if you `grep -i 'logitech'` you get

```
Bus 003 Device 002: ID 046d:c545 Logitech, Inc. USB Receiver
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 046d:c08b Logitech, Inc. G502 HERO Gaming Mouse
```

then we know, we have 2 logotech devices connected via usb, one is a mouse, another one is a receiver, in my case, this receiver connectes to my keyboard wirelessly.



TODO: add `lspci` & `lsof`, I'm still learning about them :(
