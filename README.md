Notes about bash scripting to reference when memory fails me

It has 3 parts:

1. principles.md: rules and tools to take advantage of when reading/writing bash scripts
2. cookbook.md: a list of examples that details how to solve a specific problem
3. commands.md: usages of common commonds

I plan to add another part documenting basic bash syntax in the near future

This repo does not try to cover every single detail but strives to document all the major topics.
