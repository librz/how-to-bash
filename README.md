I'm someone who can't memorize most things, not more than 3 minutes.

For that, I need to write down some notes, this repo is notes about bash scripting.

It has 2 parts:

1. basic.md: basic rules and principles when writing bash scripts
2. cookbook.md: a list of examples that details how to solve a specific problem
