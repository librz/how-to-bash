Notes about bash scripting to reference when memory fails me

It has 2 parts:

1. basic.md: basic rules and principles when writing bash scripts
2. cookbook.md: a list of examples that details how to solve a specific problem

This repo does not try to cover every single detail but strives to document all the major topics.
